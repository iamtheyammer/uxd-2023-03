## Formal Usability Study Plan

Kat Canavan, Ian Eykamp, Cole Marco, Sam Mendelson, Kristin Xu

We will test two different locations to launch the software on the computer, and we’ll measure the time it takes for users to re-open the software after closing it. We’ll A/B test putting the open button on the right-hand side of the screen and in the Windows taskbar. 

One of the things our team has been struggling with is where to put the button to open the application. While we want it to be accessible and always visible, we don’t want it to be annoying or block anything on the page. In order to test this, we’ve created two designs.

The first puts accessibility and visibility at the forefront by placing a large arrow at the right of pages and other apps. This might block some functions of applications but is always obvious and usable.

Secondly, we put it as a large item in the Windows Taskbar. This doesn’t block any functionality by design, but is much smaller and less visible. Additionally, rather than using an icon, we used the text “Want Help?,” which fills in a gap that we realized where older adults have trouble identifying the meaning behind icons.

### Our Experiment

Participants will be briefed about an action to take on LastPass, and randomly assigned either the A or B initial page–either a semicircle button docked to the right side of the screen or an icon in the taskbar at the bottom, both of which open the sidebar when clicked. Once the user opens the bar, follows the user flow, and completes the action, the sidebar will return to its closed state, and the user will be asked to reopen it. We will see where users instinctively look to open the prototype to gauge which design is more intuitive on average. We expect to see that users will consistently remember how to reopen the application with at least one of the options, with little delay or searching around for the icon. 

**Experimental Design:** Double-blind controlled experiment

#### Subjects

* **Number of Participants:** 10 older adults (this is the ideal number, our team will be testing with 3-4 older adults given the constraints of the project timeline)
* **Inclusion Criteria:** Participants aged 60 and above, with varying levels of technology familiarity, skewed towards less familiar. Technology familiarity will be self evaluated, so we are aware we might run into self-selection bias there.

#### Procedure

1. **Introduction and Consent:** Brief participants about the experiment and obtain informed consent.
2. **Random Assignment:** Participants will be randomly assigned to Option A or Option B, ensuring an equal distribution.
3. **User Experience:** Participants perform the specified task using the assigned initial page, then the computer will measure usability metrics (task completion time, error rate, click efficiency).
4. **User Interview:** Conduct a post-task interview using the predefined questions.
5. **Data Analysis:** Analyze quantitative data for usability metrics and summarize qualitative feedback from user interviews.
6. **Switching Conditions (Optional):** If desired, repeat the experiment with a subset of participants, switching their assigned condition to validate results.

#### Iterations of Experiment

Each participant will do a single iteration to maintain independence and minimize learning effects. Not a very helpful test if users already know how to perform the action we’re testing! If a second iteration is conducted with switched conditions, the order will be counterbalanced to control for order effects.

#### Usability Metrics We’ll Evaluate

1. **Task Completion Time:** Measure the time it takes for users to initiate and complete the action within the sidebar.
2. **Error Rate:** Track the number of errors users make while interacting with the sidebar.
3. **Click Efficiency:** Evaluate the number of clicks needed to accomplish the task.
4. **Learnability:** Assess how quickly users understand the interaction pattern for opening the sidebar.

#### User Interview Questions

1. How easy was it for you to find and use the button to open the sidebar?
2. Did you encounter any difficulties during the usability experience? If yes, please describe.
3. On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being extremely uncomfortable and 10 being extremely comfortable), how comfortable were you with the chosen method?
4. Were there any aspects of the design that you particularly liked or disliked?
5. How confident do you feel about remembering how to access How To?

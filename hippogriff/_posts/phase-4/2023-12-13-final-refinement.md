During this phase we incorporated feedback from our evaluation, planned and executed four usability studies, and produced the final iteration of our prototype.

We made some significant changes in response to the feedback we were given by other students. These changes are as follows.

## Google Docs Changed to LastPass

We originally used Google Docs as the base software in our prototype since we had discussed word processors with several older adults. This turned out not to be the best choice for a demo precisely because it was already familiar, especially to our classmates. We also noticed that Google Docs has too many interactions for us to mock up in Figma and not being able to click most of the buttons on screen made it feel too unrealistic. Instead, we decided to use LastPass since it’s a complicated and unfamiliar interface. Since our testers really didn’t know how to use it they didn’t have to pretend to need our instructions. LastPass doesn’t have as many buttons as Google Docs and was easier to mock up as well.

## Removed Scrollbars and added chips

We removed sections with scroll bars and instead added smaller sections that are toggled with chips at the top. These chips allow us to hide unimportant information so as not to overwhelm users while making the experience cleaner. This is especially important for older adults who read everything on screen.


## Removed Icons

We initially had icons next to every task, like a lightning bolt to take an action for you. We realized that this was much too cluttered and we removed these icons after our feedback session.

## Redesigned Application Launch

Since the the way the application is launched is the biggest barrier to helping our users, it was important to get this right. We started with a floating circle with a question mark but our classmates said they didn’t find this intuitive. We then came up with two more launch options and conducted usability tests to determine which was the most effective. In the end, we realized a persistent button in the taskbar with the words “Want Help?” was the best solution for several reasons. First, it’s consistent with launching apps from the taskbar. It’s also _always_ visible on screen. The words mean we don’t have to depend on an icon association, something we found some older adults struggle with.

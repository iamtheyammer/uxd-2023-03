## Project

We made **How To**, an app to help older adults use technology. The app provides step-by-step instructions for common tasks, like how to send an email or how to use a password manager. It's designed to be easy to use and accessible to older adults and fills in the gaps between what they know and what they need to know.

## Phases

The class was divided into four phases, each with a different focus. We went from identifying a problem to creating a prototype of our solution in Phases 1 and 2, and then refined our prototype and tested it with users in Phases 3 and 4.
